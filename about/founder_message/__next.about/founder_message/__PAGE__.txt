At 17–18, students are still in their final formative years; education should remain holistic and well-rounded even as inclinations emerge. This stage must reinforce prior knowledge and intellect, forming a strong academic foundation for later specialisation. If a student intends to specialise at university, a broad-based cultural, linguistic, and intellectual pre-university education remains essential—the soft skills gained endure for life. Indeed, a solid pre-university education benefits adulthood both professionally and personally. We should not push career-focused education too early. Like a sapling that thrives on diverse nutrients, a student nourished broadly grows stronger and stands the best chance of flourishing. Minds reap the most when education is age-appropriate in the formative years."}]]}]
